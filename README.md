# Umbrella

![](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android/blob/master/howtouse.gif?raw=true)

Umbrella is an Android mobile app developed by [Security First](https://www.secfirst.org) that provides human rights defenders with the information on what to do in any given security situation and the tools to do it. It allows the user to choose what they want to do, such as: protect data; securely make a call/email; securely access the internet; plan secure travel; protect their office/home; conduct counter-surveillance; or deal with kidnapping, arrest or evacuation. Once a situation is chosen, the app outlines what to do and what tools to use given your circumstances. This is followed by a simple checklist of recommended actions that can be customised, saved and shared securely. Umbrella’s dashboard also provides users with an up-to-the-minute account of potential risks in their chosen location.

## Example Usage
Umbrella is designed for everyone (people looking to increase their security, folks living in high risk areas, regular travellers, business people, techies, journalists, NGO staff, aid workers, human rights defenders, social workers, environmental activists etc).

However, when we built Umbrella we tried to keep in mind the story of Glen Greenwald and Edward Snowden. Greenwald couldn't communicate with Snowden at the start because he found it cumbersome to setup encryption (he nearly missed the one of biggest storys of the decade because of this!). Also, when he (and Laura Poitras) travelled to Hong Kong - they didn't have much knowledge about how to meet securely with Snowden and detect surveillance. This is common problem for journalists and acitivists. Umbrella is designed to solve this problem (and others) by having nearly everything they would have needed to know in the one place - in their pocket.

## Main Parts of Umbrella
**Introduction:**
This is the part the user sees first. It explains briefly how the app works and the basic terms and conditions.

**Menu:** The menu is the main way for a user to navigate. It lists the dashboard, lessons and tool guides.

**My Security:**
This where you access checklists you have favourited in "My Checklists" and real time updates in "The Dashboard"

**Lessons:**
Lessons are where users can learn about topics and things that they can do to improve their security. Some of the lessons have different levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert) depending on the your needs, ability and risk. Each lesson is broken down into sections. At the end of each lesson is a list for other resources and further reading.

**Checklists:**
Checklists are quick and easy references to help users implement the advice in the lessons. You can tick them off as you complete each item. Items can be added, disabled deleted and edited. If you favourite them by clicking the star, you will then see them in "My Checklists." Checklists can also be shared in through other apps such as your email.

**Forms:**
Forms allow a user to quickly fill out and share important information about issues such as their travel plan in a high risk location or report on a digital/physical security incident.

**Dashboard:**
The dashboard contains security customFeeds from places like the UN Relief Web and the US Centers for Disease Control. You enter your location (and how often you want to be updated). Every a new update is released (e.g a disease outbreak in your location), the information comes up on the dashboard.

**Tool Guides:**
These are detailed guides about how to use software and apps mentioned in the lessons.

## Lessons

## About
Explains the licences that we use for and by Umbrella. Also says a big THANKYOU to everyone who's work we built on to make it happen.

## Dashboard Feed Sources
![](https://github.com/rorymbyrne/Umbrella_android/blob/master/DASHBOARDLOGOS.png?raw=true)

These are the sources that we currently include for real-time updated security customFeeds. For privacy reasons, users never connect directly to these services. We are always looking for more useful sources that will help users keep updated on the move.
* [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov): updates on disease and health warnings
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org): updates on natural disaster issues such as floods, earthquakes and tsunamis
* [UN / ReliefWeb](http://reliefweb.int): excellent physical security updates that amalgamate information from the UN and various NGOs - though not available in every country
* [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/travel/): updates mainly focused on the security situation for travellers and internationals - available for every country

## Settings
The three vertical dots in the top of the app. Here you can:

* Set a password
* Change the refresh interval for the security customFeeds
* Change your location
* Change your feed sources

## Requirements

You need an Android phone with a minimum version of 4.0.3 (SDK 15 - ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH_MR1)
